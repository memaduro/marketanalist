  <business_name>{{Traumfirma}}</business_name>
  <industry>{{HumanResources}}</industry>
  <current_focus>{{Brief one-paragraph description of what the company does today, including key revenue streams (e.g., climate diagnostics, workshops, certifications), pricing model (e.g., project-based, subscription), customer segments (e.g., midsize to large companies, HR departments, leadership teams), and any known growth tactics in use}}</current_focus>
  <known_challenges>{{List or paragraph of the biggest obstacles you’re aware of – e.g., limited brand awareness outside core markets, long sales cycles, HR budget constraints}}</known_challenges>
</context>

<task>
1. Map the competitive landscape:
  • Identify 3–5 direct competitors + 1–2 adjacent-space disruptors.
  • Summarize each competitor’s positioning, pricing, service model, and recent strategic moves.
2. Spot opportunity gaps:
  • Compare Traumfirma’s current tactics to competitors.
  • Highlight at least 5 high-impact growth or profitability levers *not* currently exploited by Traumfirma.
3. Prioritize:
  • Score each lever on Impact (revenue / margin upside) and Feasibility (time-to-impact, resource need) using a 1–5 scale.
  • Recommend the top 3 actions with the strongest Impact × Feasibility.
</task>

<approach>
Go VERY deep. Research far more than you normally would. Spend the time to go through up to 200 webpages — it’s worth it for the actionable insights this will deliver to Traumfirma.
Don’t just look at articles or forums — everything is fair game: competitor websites, analytics platforms, thought leadership, client case studies, and HR tech marketplaces.
